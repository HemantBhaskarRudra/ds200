1. SCATTER PLOT :

	1.1 python file : scatter.py

	1.2 Data Source : https://data.gov.in/resources/monthly-seasonal-and-annual-max-temp-series-1901-2017-0

	1.3 Operating Instructions : The scatter.py file accepts data_source_filename from command line arguments. 
		So, in terminal type : 

		python3 scatter.py <data_source_filenme> , ie.,

		python3 scatter.py Max_Temp_IMD_2017.csv

	1.4 Plot : Scatter_Plot.png

	1.5 Plot Observations : The data file 'Max_Temp_IMD_2017.csv' gives the maximum temperature for months January to December from year 1901 to 2017. The months were grouped on the basis of seasons they fall in. From wikipedia and  India Meteorological Department (IMD)  information for Climate of India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_India), I have grouped the months 'December, January and February' for Winter season, 'March, April, and May' for Summer season, 'June, July, August and September' for Monsoon Season, and 'October and Novemeber' for Autum season. I have taken the average of maximum temperature of each constituting months within a season to determine the season's 'average maximum temperature'. For the value of annual 'average maximum temperture' I have taken the average of maximum temperature of all the months within that year. From the plot scatter_plot.png, the x-axis shows the 'year' and y-axis shows the value of 'average maximum temperature' seasonwise and annual for a given year. From the plot, it can be seen that the 'avearge maximum temperature' has increased annually from year 1901 to 2017 in INDIA. There is also a steady increase in temperature per season from 1901 to 2017 in INDIA, as can be seen from plot. This effect is due increasing deforestation and global warming. The effect of global warming in making increment of temperature in INDIA could be easily seen from the plot. The global warming are results of human emissions of greenhouse gases. Strict step needs to be taken against incresing global warming like improving afforestation rate, controlling pollution and population, less usage of devices which emits greenhouse gases, etc. I am Khanmmmmmmmm
